<p>Logo is a simple programming language devised by Seymour Papert for educational purposes. A user can control the movement of a turtle which draws lines on the screen. There are four basic commands in Logo language:</p>

```
Few Commands:
fd(100) moves the turtle 100 steps forward
bk(100) move the turtle backwards by 100 steps
rt(90) turns the turtle 90° to the right
lt(90) turns the turtle 90° to the left

```
<p>Imagine that you are looking at a computer screen. On it you see a small turtle, which moves when you type commands in a language called "turtle talk," leaving a line as it goes. The command "Forward 50" causes the turtle to move straight ahead a certain distance. You soon get the idea that the numbers represent the distance it moves; they can be thought of as turtle steps. Now if you want to make it go in a different direction, you give it a command like "Right 90." It stays in the same place but turns on itself, facing east if it had previously been facing north. With this knowledge you should easily be able to make it draw a box. If that's easy for you, you can think about how to draw a circle, and if that's easy you can try a spiral. Imagine yourself moving in the outline of a box or a circle or a spiral or whatever it may be. </p>
